What I knew: How to do recycler view and getting items into a recycler view
What I didn't know: I'm still having some trouble figuring out Retrofit call, I tried but I'm not sure what I did wrong. I couldn't figure out how to add the refresh into the action bar. My next problem was since I could get the images onto the recyclerview I could implement the next activity screen.
